## :page_with_curl: About
This is my solution for the EBANX Software Engineer Take-home assignment.

### The Challenge
Build an API that can handle the requests below using your favorite programming language:
- The API consists of two endpoints, GET /balance, and POST /event;
- There's also a POST /reset to reset the state before running the test;
- Publish this API on the Internet;
- Test it using the automated test suite (if you get all green you are good to go!).

## :construction: Folder Structure
- `src/`: Contains source code files.
- `controllers/`: Contains the controller logic for handling HTTP requests.
- `models/`: Contains the model representing the account.
- `routes/`: Contains the route definitions for the API endpoints.  
- `vendor/`: Contains the dependencies installed via Composer.
- `composer.json`: Composer configuration file.
- `accounts.txt`: Text file used to store account data.
- `index.php`: Entry point of the application.

## :wrench: Built With
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
- [Slim Framework](https://www.slimframework.com/)

## ðŸ¤” How to Contribute

- Clone the project: `git clone git@github.com:JulianaVelasques/my-api.git`;
- Create your branch with your feature: `git checkout -b my-feature`;
- Install the dependencies: `composer install`;
- Commit your feature: `git commit -m 'feat: My new feature'`;
- Push to your branch: `git push -u origin my-feature`.

After the merge of your pull request is done, you can delete your branch.

## :grin: Notes
The test required building an API using our favorite programming language. While my favorite programming language is Python, I decided to challenge myself and explore a new language for this project. 
Although I had never tried PHP before, I knew that if I were to secure this job, I would be working with a system written in PHP. 
Therefore, I saw this as an opportunity to dive into PHP and familiarize myself with it as soon as possible.
Building this API using PHP was indeed a challenging experience, but it was incredibly rewarding. Throughout the process, I encountered numerous hurdles and obstacles, but each one served as a valuable learning opportunity. 
I'm really glad about my work, but I'm also aware that there's always room for improvement. So, I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or feedback you may have to enhance my beautiful php API.
